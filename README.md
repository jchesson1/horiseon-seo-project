# Horiseon SEO Prject
## Purpose
For this exercise, we were tasked to clean up a codebase so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

## HTML Elements
All HTML elements follow a logical structure.

Heading elements were listed to fall in sequential order.

## Images
The images files were originally too large and took too long to load. All images were resized to reduce total webpage size and load time.

Alt attributes were also added to the images to improve accesibility.

## Conclusion

The changes above made this website more easily acessible and organized, as well as more optimized for search engines.
